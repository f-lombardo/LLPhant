Use Case
========

There are plenty of use cases for Generative AI, and new ones are created every day.  Here are some common ones.

Based on a `survey from the MLOPS community <https://mlops.community/surveys/llm/>`_ and `this survey from Mckinsey <https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year>`_
the most common use cases for AI are the following:

-  Create semantic search that can find relevant information in a lot of data. Example: `Slite <https://slite.com/>`_
-  Create chatbots / augmented FAQ that use semantic search and text summarization to answer customer questions. Example: `Quivr <https://www.quivr.app/>`_ is using such similar technology.
-  Create personalized content for your customers (product page, emails, messages,...). Example `Carrefour <https://www.carrefour.com/en/news/2023/carrefour-integrates-openai-technologies-and-launches-generative-ai-powered-shopping>`_.
-  Create a text summarizer that can summarize a long text into a short one.

Not widely spread yet but with increasing adoption:

-  Create personal shopper for augmented ecommerce experience. Example: `Madeline <https://www.knxt-madeline.com/>`_
-  Create AI agent to perform various task autonomously. Example: `AutoGpt <https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT>`_
-  Create coding tool that can help you write or revie code. Example: `Code Review GPT <https://github.com/mattzcarey/code-review-gpt>`_
